# first-res

I initially decided to use straight JS objects, then decided linked lists were a better data structure for the task, but ran out of time while implementing. So with a few minutes remaining, made a cheeky hack file. 


Instructions: 

Fork, clone, or however you like avail yourself of a copy of the root directory of this repo.

Navigate to the root on this directory on the command line. 

From the root directory:

1. Running `node directories.js` won't get you very far (see above), but have a look at the code.
 
2. Run `node justForFun.js`
